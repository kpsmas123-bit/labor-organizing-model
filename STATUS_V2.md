# TERRAIN — Migration Status v2.0
*Tracks progress of the v1→v2.0 migration against MASTER_PLAN.md gates.*
*Update at the end of every migration session.*

---

## Current Gate: 3 — Extract scoring functions to scoring/

Config layer is in place. Regression tests are passing. Safe to begin extracting scoring
functions to `scoring/` in the next session.

---

## Phase 1 — Config Layer
- [x] `config/weights.json` created and verified
- [x] `config/thresholds.json` created and verified
- [x] `task9_fast.py` reads from config (smoke test passed)
- [x] Four deprecated scripts frozen
- [x] 79 regression tests passing
- [ ] `config/key_votes.json` — Gate 3
- [ ] `config/normalization.json` — Gate 3

---

## Gate 1 Complete (Main Repo) — 2026-06-11

### Freeze Comments
- [x] `scripts/task9_score_counties.py` — freeze comment added
- [x] `scripts/export_county_scores.py` — freeze comment added
- [x] `scripts/score_strike_activity.py` — freeze comment added
- [x] `scripts/task3_sectors.py` — freeze comment added

### Config Layer
- [x] `config/` directory created
- [x] `config/weights.json` — all formula weights from task9_fast.py + score_strike_activity.py
- [x] `config/thresholds.json` — all classification thresholds from task9_fast.py + score_strike_activity.py
- [x] `task9_fast.py` wired: `score_organizing_opportunity()`, `score_organizing_potential()` Part C,
  `classify_intervention()`, `priority_tier()` all read from config
- [x] Smoke test: `from scripts.task9_fast import _WEIGHTS, _THRESHOLDS` — Config loaded OK

### Regression Tests
- [x] `tests/test_scoring_regression.py` copied from Gate 2 worktree
- [x] 79/79 tests passing in main repo against config-wired functions

### Next Session
Gate 3: Extract scoring functions to `scoring/` modules.
Pre-condition: ✅ config layer complete, ✅ regression tests in place.
